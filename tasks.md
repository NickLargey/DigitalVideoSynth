# Tasks for Learning Graphics Programming

## Demo of work done so far

### - [ ] Build Landing Page for all projects

    - [ ] Create a simple scene with 3D text
    - [ ] Add ability to switch scenes by clicking on those links

### - [ ] Individual Demos

#### - [ ] Render Image with ThreeJS

#### - [ ] Render video with ThreeJS

#### - [ ] Render video with ThreeJS and shaders

#### - [ ] Render 3D model with ThreeJS

    - [ ] Fix rendering of whale model
    - [ ] Make Other models selectable

#### - [ ] Apply custom shaders to 3D model, video, and image

#### - [ ] Update gnukTV with selectable videos

## Efficiency

- [ ] Use WebGL to render video and 3D model with shaders
- [ ] Read through A-Frames video loader code to understand why it's so much faster than my code
- [ ] Figure out how to use hardware GPU with WebGL
- [ ] Explore integration of Rust with existing JavaScript code
- [ ] Investigate performance improvements with Rust/WASM

## Future Goals

- [ ] Re-write everything in Rust||C/C++ & WASM for performance
- [ ] Use Rust to write a custom video decoder for WebGL
- [ ] Use Rust to write a custom 3D model decoder for WebGL
- [ ] Use Rust to write a custom shader compiler for WebGL
